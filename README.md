# Design patterns in Python
Implementation of several design patterns in Python3

## Why are Design Patterns even important? 
Design patterns are time-tested solutions to common recurring software design problems. Design patterns are beneficial when writing clean, maintainable, reusable and scalable code in object oriented programming. Each design pattern is a template defining relationships between different classes and objects and each one tries to solve one particular problem. There is no  exact code that must be used for a pattern, it is actually completely customizable and depending on the context of the problem at hand. 

Design patterns are largely categorized into 3 types:
1. Creational Patterns
2. Structural Patterns 
3. Behavioral Patterns 



Design patterns are deeply rooted in the **SOLID** principles. 
These principles revolutionalized Object Oriented Programming and the way we write code.
1.   **S**ingle Responsibility
2.   **O**pen/Closed
3.   **L**iskov Substitution
4.   **I**nterface Segregation
5.   **D**ependency Inversion

Very well explained in [this](https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles) article.


## Why Python? 
I have previously used design patterns in Java, but wanted to explore and learn more about how design patterns are coded in a general purpose language like Python, which is not directly object oriented. 
This exercise will help me learn think with an object oriented lens when using Python to code applications, and also to write better and readable code and follow good coding practices.
